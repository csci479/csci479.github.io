    <p>There are two portions to this reflection. It’s a little more time-intensive, but I can’t stress how important it is to set yourself up for success for the remainder of the semester.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Individual:</em> You will read and reflect on software engineering team processes and management.</li>
  <li><em>Team:</em> You will come up with a 1-page process plan that includes roles of individuals, processes you’ll adhere to, and platforms you’ll use to support those processes.</li>
</ul>

<p>In CSCI 205, some students didn’t have a good experience with agile. But you should reflect on how this project environment is different. You are working with an external client. That means that you could have changing and/or unstable requirements. It also means that the scale of your project is larger, with more complex moving parts.
<em>This is up to you.</em></p>

<p>A key point of this semester is that I’m not going to dictate precisely how you are to operate (more give you a framing). However, I do expect significant reflection and action surrounding your processes. This is your opportunity to really buy into professional processes for productivity.</p>

<h3 id="individually-0905">Individually (09.05)</h3>

<p>Before you continue, make sure you familiarize yourself with the agile processes you learned 205:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://blog.trello.com/beginners-guide-scrum-and-agile-project-management">The Beginner’s Guide to Scrum and Agile Project Management</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@takeshi.yoshida/a-pretty-good-summary-of-lean-agile-scrum-168cf123748">A Pretty Good Summary of Lean, Agile, Scrum</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Spend some time coming up with the structural mechanisms by which your team will operate. Amy Ko’s <em>Cooperative Software Development</em> has a fantastic summary of the research and practices surrounding effectives teams. Look over at least two of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/communication.html">Communication</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/productivity.html">Productivity</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/process.html">Process</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/15au/readings/DisciplineOfTeams-KatzenbachSmith.htm">The Discipline of Teams (by Katzenbach and Smith)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have a good sense of what makes an effective team, answer the following questions in 1 page. You may use bullet points if you’d like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Come up with a <strong>COMMUNICATION</strong> plan that involves <em>knowledge-sharing tools</em> (from Amy Ko article on communication). <em>How will you communicate? How often?</em>
<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Come up with a plan to reduce Sedano’s <em>taxonomy of waste</em> to make sure that your team is <strong>PRODUCTIVE</strong>. <em>What tools will you use? Who is responsible for what?</em>
<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Similarly, how do you expect to amplify your team’s <strong>PROCESS.</strong> If you are familiar with senior design, you’ll know that you should be using an agile scrum development process. However, those guidelines still leave a lot of ambiguity and interpretation that you can sculpt to your particular needs. Consider how to integrate notions of <em>awareness, ownership, distance, product value.</em> <em>How will you know what’s happening in your team? Who owns what?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have a copy to bring to your team in class on 09.05.</p>

<h3 id="as-a-team-905--907">As a Team (9.05 + 9.07)</h3>
<p>Now that you have come up with plans independently, merge together as a team and get on the same page. By the end of class on 09.07, you should have a bullet point list that answers the same questions that you answered above. Include it in your team Drive folder!</p>
