<strong>Public Demo Time (Optional:</strong> 12/4, 12pm, Dana 132</p>

<h2 id="final-project-report">Final Project Report</h2>
<p>Your final report is a summation of all the work that you have accomplished over the course of the semester. It should act as a standalone document. As a result, you may draw heavily from your previous reports in the class, including your system design and your progress reports. It is okay to duplicate information from those reports <strong>as long as it is updated, accurate, and professional in quality</strong>.</p>

<p>A report of 7-10 pages that should include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Overview / Introduction</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>An overview of the motivation behind your project</li>
      <li>An overview of your solution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Project Description</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>What are the major features / use cases?</li>
      <li>This section should be picture-heavy to give readers a sense of of the <em>user-facing</em> functionality. Link to the demo video that you created (see below)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>System Design</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This section may draw heavily on your system design doc (although make sure it is updated!)</li>
      <li>You should have an image that gives an overview of the system design</li>
      <li>Describe your system design, being sure to reference the components in your image.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Team Processes</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This section should draw heavily from your progress reports</li>
      <li>What team processes did you use and what were your roles?</li>
      <li>Make sure to include images where appropriate - of the mechanisms you used to keep track of tasks (ex: Trello), as well as your burndown chart.</li>
      <li>Reflection: What worked or didn’t work about your processes for this project? What might you change if you did it again?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Conclusion</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Given more time, what are ways that your application could be improved (if any)?</li>
      <li>A good wrap-up paragraph or two that summarizes your project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is your final product and it should reflect the professional style and structure that we have been shooting for over the course of this semester! I would <em>heavily</em> encourage you to use the Overleaf template that is linked to from our shared Drive folder (or a similarly styled professional template).</p>

<h3 id="team-presentation">Team Presentation</h3>
<p>The team presentation should aim at faculty and students who have sufficient computing experiences. The presentation should contain the following points and should be <strong>no more than 15 minutes</strong>. There is no lower limit on your presentation time.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>What is the problem?:</em> An overview of your problem</li>
  <li><em>What is your answer?:</em> An overview of your solution (how it meets your clients needs)</li>
  <li><em>Showing your solution:</em> A demo of your solution (or you could play your demo video!)</li>
  <li><em>How did you build it?:</em> An overview of your technical infrastructure</li>
  <li><em>How did your development processes contribute towards your goal?:</em> A reflection on how your team processes worked and/or didn’t work to produce high quality</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-demo-video">Final Demo Video</h3>
<p>Demo videos have the potential to last far longer than working demos. In that spirit, you should have a demo video that that demonstrates the core interactions of your interface. By the end of the video, it should be clear what the primary functions of your app are.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-good-video">What is a <em>good</em> video?</h4>

<p>Good videos have good visuals and good sound. The advice seems obvious, but the number of submissions that I see every year with blurry input and the soundscape of a wind tunnel tells me that these ideas need to be reinforced.</p>

<p>Decide whether you want to use music, captions, narrative or some kind of combination of them. For the love of god, don’t create a silent demo video. Below, you’ll find some nice resources for music that you can include as a backdrop to your product.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.process.st/product-demo-video/"><em>How to Create Your First Product Demo Video as a Total Newbie</em></a>: You might not necessarily use the same tech in the article, but many of the principles remain.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Good Examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S00H-rz7fGo"><em>Clear for iPhone</em></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Us1Ws4i14c"><em>Orchestra unveils Mailbox</em></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kk3AbP3SI0"><em>Facebook Messenger Chat with Bot Demo</em></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Somewhere in your design post, a demo video should be embedded that shows interaction with your final project.</p>

<h4 id="multimedia-for-your-videos">Multimedia for your Videos</h4>
<p>Since our intention is to be able to broadly share these videos, it is important that we take into account copyright considerations. Fortunately, Bucknell has compiled a wonderful list of resources that should provide you with a vast library of sound, video, and images to accompany your videos and make them look as professional as possible.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://researchbysubject.bucknell.edu/c.php?g=89792&amp;p=579601"><em>Bucknell’s Music and Sound resources</em></a>: In particular, I would recommend the AudioBlocks link on this site, which Bucknell has a license for. I have found it to be a great resources for everything from sound effects to background music.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://researchbysubject.bucknell.edu/c.php?g=89792&amp;p=579600"><em>Bucknell’s Video Resources</em></a>: Similar to AudioBlocks, VideoBlocks will allow you to download snippets of video that you can freely use in your own movies (if needed).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="recording-your-video">Recording your Video</h4>
<p>Your video should be as high quality as possible. For many of your screen-based products, you’ll want some kind of screen-capturing software.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>On Mac:</strong> <em>QuickTime</em> has built-in screen capture software that will record any activity on the screen. There are other options, but this is likely the most simple.</li>
  <li><strong>On Windows:</strong> There are a number of free options on Windows - <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-free-screen-recorder">many of which can be explored in this article</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="video-editors">Video Editors</h4>
<p>You’ll also need a decent video editor to put together sight and sound.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>On Mac:</strong> <em>iMovie</em> is probably your best bet. It provides a very easy drag-and-drop interface to import music, videos, and images, as well as create basic annotations (titles).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A PDF of your written report</li>
  <li>A PDF (or PPT file) or your final presentation</li>
  <li>Final project source code in a zip format, generated from your repository. A link to your repository.</li>
  <li>1-3 minute demo video. Raw movie file should be uploaded to Drive Folder. In addition, the video should be uploaded to an accessible platform (YouTube, Vimeo link).</li>
</ul>
