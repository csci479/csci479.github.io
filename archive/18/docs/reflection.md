**Due:** End of our finals period

Because CSCI 479 is designed as a culminating experience for students, each student is required to write an individual paper to reflect on their Bucknell education. Contents should include, but not be limited to, your experiences as a student at Bucknell, your computer science education, your general education, and your extra-curriculum activities that help you grow intellectually. General length of the paper should be 2,000 to 2,500 words.

The intended audience of the paper should be someone who knows Bucknell and the general concept of college undergraduate education.

While the language of this document will be more reflective in nature, I will still be evaluating your clarity and structure of your document. So I would encourage you to use a professional template and structure it in a similar way that you have

**I find these reflections very valuable.** When we talk about decisions as a department, or even meet as a university.
