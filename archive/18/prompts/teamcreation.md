### Finally...
Reflect. Write a 1-page entry titled `0 Team Factors` about what _you_ think will make a great time. Identify specific factors you would look for and try to articulate _how_ you should weight them. Make sure to include links to the sources you found.

There is no right answer here. We'll be using these to build a consensus in the class about how to form teams.
