### First...
Find at least two resumes from other people online that fit the following criteria:
1. Are made to target the same (or similar) careers that you envision for yourself.
2. That you consider to be "well done".

### Next...
If you haven't created a resume that you're happy with, make one. If you have one, make sure that it is up-to-date.

### Finally...
Create a folder in your Individual Drive Folder called _Resumes_. Include your resume and copies of the two you found. Bring printouts of all three to class. We'll be helping each other present ourselves in the best possible way.
