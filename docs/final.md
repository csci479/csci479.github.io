## Final Project Report
Your final report is a summation of all the work that you have accomplished over the course of the semester. It should act as a standalone document. As a result, you may draw heavily from your previous reports in the class, including your system design and your progress reports. It is okay to duplicate information from those reports **as long as it is updated, accurate, and professional in quality**.

A report of _at least_ 7-10 pages that should include the following:

- **Overview / Introduction**
  - An overview of the motivation behind your project
    - What is the problem? Who is the client? Why is it hard/interesting?
  - An overview of your solution

- **Project Description**
  - What are the major features / use cases?
  - This section should be picture-heavy to give readers a sense of of the _user-facing_ functionality. Link to the demo video that you created (see below)

- **System Design**
  - This section may draw heavily on your system design doc (although make sure it is updated!)
  - You should have an image that gives an overview of the system design
  - Describe your system design, being sure to reference the components in your image.

- **Team Processes**
  - This section should draw heavily from your progress reports
  - What team processes did you use and what were your roles?
  - Make sure to include images where appropriate - of the mechanisms you used to keep track of tasks (ex: Trello), as well as your burndown chart.
  - Reflection: What worked or didn't work about your processes for this project? What might you change if you did it again?

- **Conclusion**
  - Given more time by another engineering team, what are ways that your application should be improved (if any)?
  - A good wrap-up paragraph or two that summarizes your project.

This is your final product and it should reflect the professional style and structure that we have been shooting for over the course of this semester! 

### Team Presentation
The team presentation should aim at faculty and students who have sufficient computing experiences. The presentation should contain the following points and should be **no more than 15 minutes**. 
- _What is the problem?:_ An overview of your problem
- _What is your answer?:_ An overview of your solution (how it meets your clients needs)
- _Showing your solution:_ A live demo of your solution (or you could play your demo video!)
- _How did you build it?:_ An overview of your technical infrastructure
- _How did your development processes contribute towards your goal?:_ A reflection on how your team processes worked and/or didn't work to produce high quality

### Final Demo Video
Demo videos have the potential to last far longer than working demos. In that spirit, you should have a demo video that that demonstrates the core interactions of your interface. By the end of the video, it should be clear what the primary functions of your app are.

#### What is a _good_ video?
Good videos have good visuals and good sound. The advice seems obvious, but the number of submissions that I see every year with blurry input and the soundscape of a wind tunnel tells me that these ideas need to be reinforced.

Decide whether you want to use music, captions, narrative or some kind of combination of them. For the love of god, don't create a silent demo video. Below, you'll find some nice resources for music that you can include as a backdrop to your product.

- [_How to Create Your First Product Demo Video as a Total Newbie_](https://www.process.st/product-demo-video/): You might not necessarily use the same tech in the article, but many of the principles remain.

**Good Examples:**

- [_Clear for iPhone_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S00H-rz7fGo)
- [_Orchestra unveils Mailbox_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Us1Ws4i14c)
- [_Facebook Messenger Chat with Bot Demo_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kk3AbP3SI0)

Somewhere in your design post, a demo video should be embedded that shows interaction with your final project.

#### Multimedia for your Videos
Since our intention is to be able to broadly share these videos, it is important that we take into account copyright considerations. Fortunately, Bucknell has compiled a wonderful list of resources that should provide you with a vast library of sound, video, and images to accompany your videos and make them look as professional as possible.

- [_Bucknell's Music and Sound resources_](http://researchbysubject.bucknell.edu/c.php?g=89792&p=579601): In particular, I would recommend the AudioBlocks link on this site, which Bucknell has a license for. I have found it to be a great resources for everything from sound effects to background music.


#### Recording your Video
Your video should be as high quality as possible. For many of your screen-based products, you'll want some kind of screen-capturing software.

- **On Mac:** _QuickTime_ has built-in screen capture software that will record any activity on the screen. You can also use other options you're familiar with (I like to use [Loom](https://www.loom.com/))
- **On Windows:** There are a number of free options on Windows - [many of which can be explored in this article](http://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-free-screen-recorder)


### Deliverable Checklist
- A PDF of your written report
- Google slides of your final presentation
- Final project source code in a zip format, generated from your repository. 
- 1-3 minute demo video. Raw movie file should be uploaded to Drive Folder. In addition, the video should be uploaded to an accessible platform (YouTube, Vimeo link).

- A README that includes:
  - A video link to your demo from an accessible platform (YouTube, Vimeo). If you are uncomfortable with publicizing your product, you may generate a private link
  - A link to your repository (I should have permission to at least view it).
