- **Written Report Due:** 10/10
- **Presentations:** 10/10, 10/12

While we will frequently exchange information through weekly meetings over the course of the semester, two formal progress reports and presentations are required. Each report should include the following information (it does not need to be in this order):

- **Overview**
  - A _brief_ overview of your project and client. This may be very similar (or even identical) to material included in your system design document.
  - An overview of your processes. What are the roles of the members of your group (we discussed these in your team meetings)? What are the mechanisms you are using to keep up with agile/scrum methodologies?

- **Current status of the project:**
  - What is the status of communication with your client?:
    - If any requirements from your client have changed, discuss them.
  - What has been completed so far? Make your work more concrete through images.
    - Identify what has changed since your System Design
  - To contextualize your progress and remaining work, include your burn down chart. This should also give a visual approximation of the work that you have left to complete.

- **Reflection on challenges:**
  - This may include _technical_ challenges related to the construction of your application, _communication_ challenges that are related to your client, or _team_ challenges that are related to your team-based processes (for example, keeping up with agile/scrum).
  - How are you planning on meeting those challenges? Make this as concrete as possible. For example 'work harder' isn't a concrete solution. Instead, tell me how you will enforce team accountability and transparency that directly results in productivity.

- **Plan for the rest of the semester**
  - What are you focusing on now?
  - What are the critical points of potential failure? (What are you worried about?)
  - Given your current trajectory, when do you expect to complete an alpha version of your product?

**Deliverables**
- **Written Report:** The written report is expected 3-5 pages, single-spaced. Refer to our [writing rubric](../rubrics/writing.pdf)
- **Presentation:** The presentation is expected to be 15 minutes long (10 minutes of presentation, 5 minutes of questions). That's not much time! - so be clear in your communication and cover each of the major points listed above. Refer to our [presentation rubric](../rubrics/presentation.pdf)
