### First...
Read. [Chapter 2 of "Software Engineering at Google: Lessons Learned from Programming Over Time" - How to Work Well on Teams](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F4h0-93Tc07DJ-37XyNNGBv68MCmt77C/view?usp=sharing)

### Then...
Look. Find at least two other sources online that discuss how to make good software engineering teams (or broadly just good teams). They can reference either a professional or academic environment. It's up to you. 

### Finally...
Reflect. Write a 1-page entry about what _you_ think will make a great team. Identify **specific factors** you would look for and try to articulate _how_ you should weight them. Make sure to include links to the sources you found.

There is no right answer here. We'll be using these to build a consensus in the class about how to form teams.
