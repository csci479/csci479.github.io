Once you have a team... it's time to merge your independent ideas and get on the same page. By the end of 09.07, you should have a bullet point list that answers similar questions to those you answered in the individual  - what is the communication plan? What are the work expectations? How will you promote transparency and accountability? 

**Constraints and guidelines:**
- Each team needs to minimally maintain a Product Backlog, Spring Backlog, and some view of progress (such as a burn down chart). 
- What tools will you use to organize project work (prev bullet point)? What repositories will you use for code and documentation? _Make sure that I can have access to any organization platforms you use_
- Write a **COMMUNICATION** plan that involves _knowledge-sharing tools_ (from Amy Ko article on communication). _How will you communicate? How often? What platform will you use? What are the group expectations about meeting and collaborative work?_
- What roles will members of your team primarily fill? What are their core responsibilities? 
- Do you have a code of conduct? Ground rules for handling tension or disagreement? 

**My expectations are that these are concrete.** For example, we have talked in class about how it's easy to say "We will communicate frequently" and harder to articulate what "frequently" means. But that specificity is important for setting expectations and collectively knowing whether group members are meeting, exceeding, or falling short of those expectations.
