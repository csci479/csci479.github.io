_A one semester project development course is VERY quick. My goal is to have both
our teams and projects selected by the start of the 3rd week. To do that, we need
a quick assessment of the potential projects..._

### First...
Make sure you have access to the list of projects + your information (via Google Classroom):

You will be considered an "expert" for the project that you have signed up for. The goal of this assignment is simply to explore one of the projects and convey information to the rest of the class, it does _not_ have any impact on which project you will end up on.

**Sign up for 2 projects on the shared Google spreadsheet:** There will be some overlap, but there should be no more than 2 students on each project, and each project should have at least 1 student. 

### Then...
For each of those projects, think through the project as much as possible. For your projects,
create the following in _Google Slides_ (this will allow us to comment on the work by each other):

**Use 1-slide-per-project** - use the slide template provided in Google Classroom
- Overview. Give a _brief_ summary of what project. Try to just keep it one sentence if you can.
- 2 potential (or interesting points) to this project.
- 2 potential obstacles/challenges to this project.

**To submit:** 
- Make sure you to submit your slides via Google Classroom
- Copy and paste your 2 slides into our shared Rapid-fire slideshow. 

### To submit...
On Friday, we will give rapid fire presentations (**only 2-3 minutes each!**) of your projects, and then leave some time to comment and ask questions.
