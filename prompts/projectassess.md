_A one semester project development course is VERY quick. My goal is to have both
our teams and projects selected by the start of the 3rd week. To do that, we need
a quick assessment of the potential projects..._

### First...
Make sure you have access to the assignment + list of projects on Google Classroom. 

**Sign up for 2 projects on the shared Google spreadsheet (`Project Pitch Sign-up - CSCI 479`):** There will be some overlap, but there should be no more than 2 students on each project, and each project should have at least 1 student. 

You will be considered an "expert" for the project that you have signed up for. The goal of this assignment is to simply to explore one of the projects and convey information to the rest of the class, it does _not_ have any impact on which project you will end up on.

### Then...
For each of those projects, think through the project as much as possible. Remember some of the tensions and goals we discussed in our first class. What would make this project compelling to our class? What are the risks if a group chose to adopt it? 

**Create 1-slide-per-project** - to do this, modify the slide template provided in Google Classroom (`ProjectPitch-template`). It should include: 
- 2 potential opportunities or strengths of this project.
- 2 potential obstacles/challenges of this project.

### To submit...
- Make sure you to **submit your slides via Google Classroom** (`ProjectPitch-template`)
- Copy and paste your 2 slides into our shared Rapid-fire slideshow. (either `ProjectPitch-479-01-1pm` or `ProjectPitch-479-02-2pm`)
- On Friday, be ready to give rapid fire presentations (**only 2-3 minutes each!**) of your projects. Your presentation should include a _summary_ of the project proposal + your assessment. 

We'll leave some time to comment and/or ask questions.
