_A one semester project development course is VERY quick. My goal is to have both
our teams and projects selected by the start of the 3rd week. To do that, we need
a quick assessment of the potential projects..._

### First...
Make sure you have access to the list of projects + your information:
- List of projects
- List of assignments

You will be considered an "expert" for the project that you have been assigned.
This process is simply to convey information to the rest of the class, it does
_not_ have any impact on which project you will end up on.

### Then...
You should know as much about the project as possible.
_TODO_

### Finally...
On Friday, we will sit in panels in which the "experts" will answer questions
(as best as possible)
