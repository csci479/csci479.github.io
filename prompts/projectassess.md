_A one semester project development course is VERY quick. My goal is to have both
our teams and projects selected by the start of the 3rd week. To do that, we need
a quick assessment of the potential projects..._

### First...
Make sure you have access to the list of projects + your information:
- List of projects: a folder in 
- List of student/project assignments

You will be considered an "expert" for the project that you have been assigned.
This process is simply to convey information to the rest of the class, it does
_not_ have any impact on which project you will end up on.

### Then...
You should know as much about the project as possible. For your projects,
create the following in _Google Slides_ (this will allow us to comment on the work by each other):

**Use 1-slide-per-project:**
- Overview. Give a _brief_ summary of what project. Try to just keep it one sentence if you can.
- 2 potential  (or interesting points) to this project.
- 2 potential obstacles/challenges to this project.

You'll put your slides in a shared Google Drive folder. Please name them using the following convention: `projectName_yourName`

### Finally...
On Friday, we will give rapid fire presentations (**only 2-3 minutes each!**) of the selected projects, and then leave some time to comment and ask questions.
