_This prompt should be approximately 1 page single-spaced in Google Docs. They should have subheadings, your name, and be completed by the date on the homepage_

### Resources to Read
- Look over [ACM's 2018 Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)
- 1 Page poster on [Ethical Decision Making](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/ethical-decision-making-poster/)
- Many of you will be in leadership positions in the future, read this infographic on [The Practice of Ethical Leadership](https://www.scu.edu/media/ethics-center/ethical-decision-making/MARK_0418_EthicalLeadershipInfographic-(3).pdf)

### Then...
In `Resources` directory of our `479_Public` Drive folder, look over the reflective prompts in `tarot_cards_of_tech.pdf`

You will be thinking through ethical blind spots in 2 _other_ projects in the class.
- On Slack, list your name under 2 projects
- For each project, answer the prompts of at least 2 of the tarot cards. Many of them may not apply,  but I encourage you to really reflect on what _could_ happen if someone was really bent on abusing your technology (what would the writers of _Black Mirror_ do with your project?)

### Finally
On Friday, we will have mini-panels thinking through how the technology we're building could potentially be abused.
