_This prompt should be approximately 1 page single-spaced. They should have subheadings, your name, and be completed by Friday at 12pm_

### Resources to Read
- Look over [ACM's 2018 Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)
- 1 Page poster on [Ethical Decision Making](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/ethical-decision-making-poster/)
- Many of you will be in leadership positions in the future, read this infographic on [The Practice of Ethical Leadership](https://www.scu.edu/media/ethics-center/ethical-decision-making/MARK_0418_EthicalLeadershipInfographic-3.pdf)
- Read the _Tarot Cards of Tech_ that is atttached to the Google Classroom assignment. 

### Then...
Individually, you will be thinking through ethical blind spots in your project. 
- To make this concrete, you should pick 3 of the tarot cards that you think could apply to your system. Many of them may not apply, but I encourage you to really reflect on what _could_ happen if someone was really bent on abusing your technology (or the outcome of your project)
- Before turning it in on Google Classroom, **print out a copy that you can bring to class**

### Finally
On Friday, we will discuss with groups, and also with the class, some of the ethical implications of our work. Each group will add a section to their _System Design_ document that explicitly discusses the "Broader Impact" of their projects.
