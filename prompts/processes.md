There are two portions to this reflection. It's a little more time-intensive, but I can't stress how important it is to set yourself up for success for the remainder of the semester.
- *Individual:* You will read and reflect on software engineering team processes and management.
- *Team:* You will come up with a 1-page process plan that includes roles of individuals, processes you'll adhere to, and platforms you'll use to support those processes.

In CSCI 205, some students didn’t have a good experience with agile. But you should reflect on how this project environment is different. You are working with an external client. That means that you could have changing and/or unstable requirements. It also means that the scale of your project is larger, with more complex moving parts.
_This is up to you._

A key point of this semester is that I’m not going to dictate precisely how you are to operate (more give you a framing). However, I do expect significant reflection and action surrounding your processes. This is your opportunity to really buy into professional processes for productivity.

### Individually (09.05)

Before you continue, make sure you familiarize yourself with the agile processes you learned 205:
- [The Beginner's Guide to Scrum and Agile Project Management](https://blog.trello.com/beginners-guide-scrum-and-agile-project-management)
- [A Pretty Good Summary of Lean, Agile, Scrum](https://medium.com/@takeshi.yoshida/a-pretty-good-summary-of-lean-agile-scrum-168cf123748)

Spend some time coming up with the structural mechanisms by which your team will operate. Amy Ko’s _Cooperative Software Development_ has a fantastic summary of the research and practices surrounding effectives teams. Look over at least two of the following:
- [Communication](http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/communication.html)
- [Productivity](http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/productivity.html)
- [Process](http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/process.html)
- [The Discipline of Teams (by Katzenbach and Smith)](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/15au/readings/DisciplineOfTeams-KatzenbachSmith.htm)

Once you have a good sense of what makes an effective team, answer the following questions in 1 page. You may use bullet points if you'd like:
- Come up with a **COMMUNICATION** plan that involves _knowledge-sharing tools_ (from Amy Ko article on communication). _How will you communicate? How often?_
<br/><br/>
- Come up with a plan to reduce Sedano's _taxonomy of waste_ to make sure that your team is **PRODUCTIVE**. _What tools will you use? Who is responsible for what?_
<br/><br/>
- Similarly, how do you expect to amplify your team's **PROCESS.** If you are familiar with senior design, you'll know that you should be using an agile scrum development process. However, those guidelines still leave a lot of ambiguity and interpretation that you can sculpt to your particular needs. Consider how to integrate notions of _awareness, ownership, distance, product value._ _How will you know what's happening in your team? Who owns what?_

Make sure you have a copy to bring to your team in class on 09.05.

### As a Team (9.05 + 9.07)
Now that you have come up with plans independently, merge together as a team and get on the same page. By the end of class on 09.07, you should have a bullet point list that answers the same questions that you answered above. Include it in your team Drive folder!
