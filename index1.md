# CSCI 479: Computer Science Design Project
After 3 years at Bucknell, you've gained an extraordinary amount of technical knowledge. This is your opportunity to own a larger scale project from top to bottom. But more importantly, it's an opportunity to figure out a design process that you'll need for years after graduation. To that end, you will complete a semester-long project for an external client while applying and reflecting on software engineering processes.
