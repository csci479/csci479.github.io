# CSCI 479: Computer Science Design Project
After 3 years at Bucknell, you've gained an extraordinary amount of technical knowledge. This is your opportunity to own a larger scale project from top to bottom. But more importantly, it's an opportunity to figure out a design process that you'll need for years after graduation. To that end, you will complete a semester-long project for an external client while applying and reflecting on software engineering processes.  

- **Who:** [Prof. Evan Peck](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/)
- **Where:** BRKI 165
- **When:** 3:00 - 3:52pm, Mon/Wed/Fri

- Look up information about our guest, their company, and their role.
- Submit a question on Slack for our guest **5pm the day before** their virtual visit.
- **Before 8:30am** the morning of their call, indicate which current questions on Slack that you like (with emoji, a comment, etc.). We will ask the top 3-5 questions submitted.
Your active participation in generating questions and being engaged during our conversations will contribute towards the _Participation_ portion of your grade.

## Schedule
_Due to the seminar nature of this course, the second half of the semester is intentionally left open-ended to allow us to address issues that are of particular interest to the class_
